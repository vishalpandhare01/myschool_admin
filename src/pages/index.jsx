        With these changes, the layout will now: Be fully responsive, showing a
        collapsible sidebar on mobile. Display icons for each menu item in the
        sidebar. Have a smooth transition when opening and closing the sidebar
        on mobile. Ensure that the content area adapts to the sidebarâ€™s presence
        and shifts smoothly when the sidebar is opened on smaller screens.
        Testing: To test this: On a desktop, the sidebar should always be
        visible. On a mobile or small screen, the sidebar should be hidden by
        default and can be opened by clicking the menu button in the AppBar.
        This should now work as expected, with a fully responsive layout. Let me
        know if you have any further questions or issues!
